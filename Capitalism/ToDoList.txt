Ok gamers, this is the TO DO LIST of all of the program. this is very important. do not delete it. i swear to god if you delete this i will... uh. whats another word for kill thats more..
family friendly.      GAME END. thats right, imma game end you.

There will be a lot of spelling errors, i cant spell. TDL means TO-DO-LIST, and anything caps is important.



TDL for Game1




TDL for Board




TDL for Starting_Screen

* There are 3 buttons, Start, Rules, and Options.
* Make another button for exit, but make it small at the bottem (might be changed)
* All buttons do the effect I made in Sorry, just copy and paste that there.
* For START, once its prest, the screen changes more buttons to select how many players there are.
  once they select the players, SAVE THAT INFO, and then show dice in the middle. do the dice thing
  i never bothered to do while playing (aka who goes first, and who goes last)
  Once that is done, make the choose who they want to be, and then start the game.

* For RULES, just control c, control v the rules in monoploy. it just works

* For OPTIONS, now this is where the fun begins. Now just 1000 easter eggs. thats it. go crazy
